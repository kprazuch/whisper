       "\" A service level agreement or SLA is a standard industry term. It's the formal agreement between a service provider and customer that guarantees the customer a stated level of service. The service provider may be a commercial company providing the service, like Microsoft, when you use Azure services. But SLAs are also used inside organizations, and an agreement between the IT department and the business users. Let's look at what SLAs mean for Azure. Azure service level agreements are represented as a percentage, related to the service or applications availability. This availability is also known as uptime. If the service was always available to use, you'd say it was 100% available, or it had 100% uptime. And SLA also commonly includes details like what is defined as downtime when the service is unavailable, and any credit you may be entitled to if the SLA is not met. In reality, 100% uptime is difficult and expensive to achieve, because it allows no time for taking the service down for required maintenance or upgrades. It would also require duplicating every single component in case one component failed, and would require those backup components to pick up the service tasks with zero interruption to the customer. For these reasons, SLAs of 99% 99.9% and 99.95% are more common. 99.99% is also available in some services in Azure. Is there a big difference in a service that's 99% available? Versus one that's 99.9% available? Yes! A service with a 99% SLA percentage can be unavailable for up to 1.6 hours per week or 7.2 hours per month and still be 99% available. That time is cumulative, which means it can be added up over multiple incidents of the service being unavailable. A service with a 99.9 SLA percentage can be unavailable for only 10 minutes per week or 43.2 minutes per month. That's clearly a big difference. If the service is critical to your business, minutes versus hours of downtime can make a big difference, but highly available services do come at an extra cost. Each Azure service has its own SLA. Familiarize yourself with them prior to designing any application that runs on Azure to ensure your optimizing availability against your business needs.\""

      " Welcome back everyone. Seth Meyers is joining us today. Thank you for being here, bud. Yeah. During this this this writer's track, you also started another podcast. Yes. I love this one with your brother Josh. Yes. I love it. By the way, give him my best. I will. He used to do stuff with you on the show. On late night? Yes. And yeah, it's called Family Trips with the Meyers Brothers. We had this idea for years and we decided to do this. It was a good time to get it off the ground. Why Family Trips? So we talked to celebrities and we only talked to them about the trips they took when they were kids. And it's really fun because you realize what a great equalizer it is. A very few of the celebrities you know and love had money when they were kids. And it's just a lot. And also for Josh and I, we grew up in the 70s and early 80s. And so many people like us took trips where they were just in the back of a station wagon. No seat belts. Nobody even thought about seat belts. The amount of kids is like, my parents put down a mattress. We had a card table. And we just slide around. Then there's random gamblers back there with the kids. In the family. Strangers you picked up in the pickup dealers. Yeah, go play poker with my kids. Yeah, exactly. But it's fun. And you just realize, especially the more trips go wrong, I feel like the more they enter the family lore and those disaster trips are the ones you talk about for years and years with your family because you survived them and it brought you all closer. And so it's nice talking to people about all those things and how do you got coming up on that podcast? We got Nate Bargazzi. I know a huge name Bargazzi fan right here. Nick Offerman's coming up. John Malaney's coming up. And so it's just a full delight. You're going to do it, right? I'm so in. I can't wait. The podcast, bro, is now you got it. We have to do it. We're podcast, bro. I already got my trip planned out. I can't wait. I have on the gear. Yeah, you do have all the gear. What am I going to do with all this gear? I know. It's very nice. Kimmel is like, if you're doing this podcast, or did this mixer, these headphones, I got this microphone thing. I go, oh my gosh, I don't know what. He gave us like Amazon link. I wanted to talk about, I almost forgot. The best thing about Strike Force 5 is we all, like we all have better as we went. Because the first room, you did the first two episodes in a room and I've never seen Jimmy look hotter. He chose, he chose to, and again, we started in August. There was terrible ventilation. And just it was like watching you melt. Well, I would didn't know what room to do the podcast and nothing was really quiet. And so I went, we have like a guest cottage. So I went to this cottage thing and there was a loud cricket. It was so loud, I go, they're going to think, and I would have to stomp on the floor and then it would be quiet. I go, I can't do this for the whole. Wait, the cricket would be quiet if you stomp. So it was a very, it was a respectful cricket. Trained cricket. Yeah. I don't know why we're wearing that amateur cricket. Yeah. He's famous. You might, Jiminy? Oh, Jiminy? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's pretty famous. He's been a couple films. Oh my god. Yeah, I know. I don't know how to name drop, but I hang it with cartoons. Well. You don't know me? I was my whole world apart. That was with the Jiminy cricket. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're old, old, buddy. If you don't want to bring them on the podcast. What is he going to talk about? Pinocchio. Yeah. That's not a hack of a. Well, I need not in the new one. So I went to this room. And with this room, there was no air conditioning. I was just shoved in so I could get out of everyone's way. It was so hot. Yeah. And I go, oh my gosh, we did two episodes. And we were just trying to figure out. So I think it was like four hours. The first day was long. But then here's why I was, I wasn't mad. It was making me laugh. Everything was making me laugh. But because I was like, I got to get out of here. Because I'm going to die. I mean, I'm like, my face is red. I was, so I texted everybody on straight for it. So this is the craziest thing. So Jimmy is talking to four of us on. It's not a live podcast. So anything he says, we could just edit out. I know. I know. I know. But instead, he chooses to text us. Why didn't he be able to read it? So I texted everyone, hey, I'm going to get out of here. And I'm like, wrap it up. Let's go, man. I'm like, who am I supposed to end? And then you know, Colbert. I mean, they're like, hey, I just got a text room, Jimmy. He's got to go. And we're like, what? It'd be like if you were a dinner with one other person, and you texted them, how much longer is this dinner here? Yeah. Oh my god. Totally must have been all that. So you and Oliver are doing stand-up together. Yeah, John Oliver and I, we're going to do New Year's Eve in Las Vegas. Very exciting. That's going to be fun. And I'm also very excited to be doing a fundraising show in New Hampshire and Manchester. That's my home state. It's a fundraiser for a couple of great organizations, Granite State Children Alliance, and Casa. So if you live in the Granite State, come check it out because it's a really special night. You're a good man. We always love it when you stop by. That's my Strike 4-5. But right there, Seth Meyers, everybody, stay tuned. Late night with Seth Meyers, there's week nights, including Wednesday. Right after the tonight show, it's also available on peacock. Stick around. We'll be right back, everybody.\n"
